# The purpose & significance of Git in DevOps

Git able to track code and keeping history. The importance in devops is about collaboration and making sure code is stored properly, able to retrieve back the same way it was stored and able to do code branch while not stopping other people to commit (unlike subversion or centralize based source code management).

# brief summary of your experience with Git, including the merge conflict you encountered and how you resolved it

I have been using git for more than 10 years as a software developer.

The merge conflict is because of the code that I push that Afiq Muzaffar failed to get latest. Therefore, Afiq just need to git pull, solve the merge conflict, choose which line of code that is needed to move forward and push back to origin.
