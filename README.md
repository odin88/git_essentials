Git is a distributed version control system that is fundamental to DevOps because it facilitates collaboration and maintains a history of code changes. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, each on their own "copy" of the project, without overwriting each other's changes. Git tracks and records all changes, making it possible to revert to previous versions if necessary. This is crucial for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), key practices in DevOps. Git also supports branching and merging, enabling feature development, experimentation, and bug fixing to happen in parallel. The changes can then be merged back into the main code. Git's distributed nature means every developer has a full copy of the project history on their local machine, allowing for easy access and robust disaster recovery. In summary, Git's capabilities make it an essential tool in the DevOps landscape.
